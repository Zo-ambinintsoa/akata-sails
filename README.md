# Akata-back

Akata-back is a task manager build on SailsJS.
We need a simple task manager to manager the tasks of our project.

I decide to implement as simple as possible and share with the community.

## Installing

### Prerequisites
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [SailsJs](https://sailsjs.com)

Assuming you already have the Nodejs, MongoDb and NPM installed let's start from SailsJs installation
```bash
$ sudo npm install sails -g
```


P.S. The app use this lines to hash the password

Now you clone the project in your system, navigate until the base project folder and run the command below
```bash
$ npm install
```

Now change the config/datastores.js to your mongodb connection.

That's it, enjoy the Youtask.
